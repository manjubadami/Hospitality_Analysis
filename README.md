## Project Summary

AtliQ Grand, a prominent chain of five-star hotels operating in major Indian cities including Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi, and Bangalore, has experienced a decline in revenue and market share. This project was undertaken to analyze AtliQ Grand's operational data and provide actionable recommendations to address this decline.  Acting as the lead analyst, I leveraged the capabilities 
of Power BI to conduct a comprehensive data analysis and generate key insights.

## Key Deliverables

This project focused on delivering actionable insights across three key areas:

### Performance Overview
This section provides a high-level overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), and occupancy rate.  
Detailed metrics, including Average Daily Rate (ADR) and guest satisfaction scores, are also presented.

### Revenue Overview
This analysis examines revenue distribution across various dimensions, including geographic location (city), hotel category, and booking platform.  
The objective is to identify opportunities for optimizing sales strategies and enhancing revenue generation.

### Booking Overview
This component explores booking patterns, cancellation trends, and guest behavior.  
The resulting insights are designed to improve operational efficiency and drive revenue growth.

## Skills and Technologies

The project leveraged the following skills and technologies:

- **Data Visualization:** Interactive dashboards were developed using Power BI to effectively communicate key findings.
- **Revenue Analysis:** Comprehensive analysis of revenue-related metrics was conducted to identify trends and opportunities.
- **Technical Proficiency:** Power BI and DAX were utilized for data modeling, transformation, and analysis.
- **Industry Terminology:** A strong understanding of hospitality industry terminology, including ADR, DSRN (Daily Sales Report Number), DBRN (Daily Booking Report Number),
RevPAR, and other relevant metrics, was essential to the project's success.

The development of these analytical views required both analytical rigor and creative problem-solving to extract meaningful insights and formulate effective recommendations.
